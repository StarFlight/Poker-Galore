As3 Crypto Library

- 1.2
  - math: Completed BigInteger support. Moved BigInteger under com.hurlant.math
  - public key: RSA decrypt and key generation
  - crud: basic DER/PEM support to parse RSA keys (X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo and PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey)
  - random: support for TLS-PRF; weak attempt at seeding Random.
  - hash: added MD2. slow legacy stuff.
  - modes: CFB, CFB8 and OFB padding bug fixes
  - secret key: TripeDES bug fix
  - demo UI: added OpenSSL Monkey tab that checks that a few operations are compatible between As3Crypto and OpenSSL
  - demo UI: added UI for RSA decryption and key generation

- 1.1
  - secret key: DES, 3DES, BlowFish
  - mode: CTR, SimpleIV
  - demo UI: Added unit tests
  - added toString() to each algorithm
  - added dispose() to each algorithm. dispose() attempts to clear keys and states from the memory, but it is not guaranteed to work.
  - build-swc.xml file to allow command-line compilation of a .SWC library file.

- Initial release (1.0)
  - public key: RSA encrypt
  - secret key: AES, XTEA, RC4
  - hash: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256
  - HMAC
  - modes: ECB, CBC, CFB, CFB8, OFB
  - converters: Base64, Hex
  - Demo UI with benchmarking
